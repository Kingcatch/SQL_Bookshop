# Bookshop Inventory Modernisation
Overview
This project involved modernising the inventory records of a local bookshop by implementing a PostgreSQL database to manage and organise data more efficiently. The goal was to replace outdated manual record-keeping with a more robust and scalable solution using SQL and PostgreSQL's features. This database allows for the management of books, authors, genres, and their relationships, providing the bookshop with a flexible system to handle daily operations such as tracking stock, sales, and inventory.

Learning Objectives
Through the completion of this project, I achieved the following learning objectives:

- Interact with the psql CLI: Gained hands-on experience using the PostgreSQL command-line interface to interact with the database.
- Create a database using psql: Learnt how to create and configure a PostgreSQL database from scratch.
- Understand common PostgreSQL data types: Explored and applied common PostgreSQL data types such as VARCHAR, INTEGER, DATE, and BOOLEAN.
- Create tables in a database: Designed and implemented tables for books, authors, and genres, with relevant fields to store data effectively.
- Insert data into tables: Inserted sample data into the tables, including books, authors, and genres, to ensure correct functionality.
- Read, update, and delete data using conditional clauses: Applied SQL queries to retrieve, update, and delete records based on specific conditions.
- Understand different types of relationships between data: Designed one-to-many relationships between books and authors and many-to-many relationships between books and genres.
- Use JOINS in SQL: Employed various JOIN operations (INNER JOIN) to combine data across related tables.
- Junction tables for many-to-many relationships: Managed many-to-many relationships between books and genres using a junction table.
- Use aggregate functions in SQL: Applied aggregate functions such as COUNT(), SUM(), and AVG() for data analysis.

Key Features

- Books Table: Stores detailed information about each book, including title, author, genre, price, and stock quantity.
- Authors Table: Contains information about authors, including name and biography.
- Genres Table: Organises books into categories, making it easier to manage different types of books.
- Books and Genres Relationship: Implemented a many-to-many relationship between books and genres using a junction table.
- SQL Queries: Use of SELECT, JOIN, UPDATE, DELETE, and aggregate functions to query and manipulate the data.
- Reports: Ability to generate reports on stock, sales, and book categories using aggregate functions and complex queries.
